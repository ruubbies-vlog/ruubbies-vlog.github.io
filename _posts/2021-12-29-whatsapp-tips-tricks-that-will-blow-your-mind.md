Right now, WhatsApp is by far the most popular instant messaging app on the planet. WhatsApp has a global user base of over 2 billion people. That isn't for no reason. Users may share messages, emoticons, stickers, photographs, GIFs, and videos using the instant messaging program, which includes dozens of functions. It also provides free voice, group, and video conversations, as well as group video calls. WhatsApp can also be used to send money!

While you may be familiar with all of WhatsApp's commonly used capabilities, such as sending messages, making or receiving calls, and sharing files, you may not be aware of all of its hidden features. In this article, we've compiled a list of useful WhatsApp tips and techniques to help you utilize the app like an expert.

We'll go through the following WhatsApp hints and tips in this article:

### **How to Find Out With Whom You Share The Most Files On WhatsApp**

* Open `WhatsApp`and go to the top right corner of the screen to the `Three-Dots Button`.
* Now, go to '**`Settings`**.'
* Select `'Storage and Data`' from the drop-down menu.
* If you go to '`Manage Storage`,' you'll be able to see with whom you've shared the most files on WhatsApp. This can be found in the Chats portion of the screen.

This area also displays how much storage is used and how much is available on your smartphone, as well as all large files and file size data for each WhatsApp contact.

### **How To Delete Older Sent WhatsApp Messages**

We're all aware that WhatsApp allows you to delete messages for everyone in a conversation thread. The feature, however, is only available until all of the contacts in the chat thread have not seen the message. However, there is a method that allows you to remove older messages that have already been seen by others.

* Open `WhatsApp`and navigate to the chat thread where you sent the message or file you want to delete. Check the date and time it was sent and make a note of it.
* Now, open the `Settings`app on your phone and update the time and date to the values listed.
* Open WhatsApp once more and navigate to the message you wish to delete or unsend.
* Now, hold down the shift key while long-pressing that message or file. The '`Delete`' option (represented by a thrash bin-shaped icon) will now appear on the top bar. Select the '`Delete`' icon.
* A pop-up menu should now appear. Select '`Delete For Everyone`' from the drop-down menu. And there you have it! For everyone in that chat thread, you've removed that message or file. It is no longer visible to anyone.

### **Format your text**

You can now send messages in **bold**, *italics* or ~~strikethrough~~ too. Simply use the special characters before and after the words to get the formatting of your choice. For example, use asterisk for bold (\*hello\*), underscore for italics (\_hello\_) and tilde for strikethrough (\~hello\~).

###  **How to Change the Sound of WhatsApp Notifications**

Did you know that you can customize your WhatsApp notification tones for individual contacts? For example, you may have one notification tone for friends and another for family members. That's not everything. You may choose the tone for messages and the tone for calls. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this

* Open `WhatsApp`and choose the contact you wish to get a custom notification for.
* Now, go to their profile and look for an option named '`Custom Notifications`.' Select Custom Notification from the drop-down menu.
* Now, click the checkbox on the right side of the 'Use Custom Notifications' option to enable it.
* Next, go to '`Notification Tone`' and select your preferred tone. The call ringtone is the same way. You can select your preferred ringtone from the list by clicking on '`Ringtone`.'

### **How To Use A Simple Trick To Stop WhatsApp From Playing Your Status**

Are you tired of having to click and hold a status message in order to see it clearly? There is, however, a clever approach you can use to keep the WhatsApp Status paused without having to hold it with your finger. Here's how to go about it.

* Go to WhatsApp's '`Status' tab` and choose it.
* Next, locate the contact whose status you'd like to view and click on their profile status.
* When their Status begins to play, touch the phone's screen with three fingers at the same time. This will pause the playback of the Status update, and you can remove your fingers from the screen at any time to continue seeing the Status update.

Isn't that quite practical?

### **What Is The Best Way To Save Someone's WhatsApp Status Update?**

Do you want to save the status of someone on WhatsApp? You may simply accomplish this by following the steps below. This functionality, however, will only work on Android phones.

* Open **WhatsApp** and go to the **WhatsApp Status** you'd like to keep.
* Now, on your Android smartphone, launch a File Manager app and allow it to expose Hidden Files. Because each manufacturer's Android smartphone or tablet uses a different **File Manager** app, the choice to expose hidden files may vary. Navigate to this folder: **`com.whatsApp >`** `WhatsApp > Media > Statuses` after you've found and enabled that option. You'll find the WhatsApp status you're looking for right here.
* Now copy that file to a different folder of your choosing.

We hope that these useful WhatsApp tips and techniques will be useful to you on a daily basis.
