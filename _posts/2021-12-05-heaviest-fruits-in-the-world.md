What are the world's heaviest fruits? The top fruits would all be pumpkins if you simply counted them. Instead, we've selected seven distinct fruits and will inform you about the most powerful of each:

**List of the World's Heaviest Fruits**

The following is a list of the world's heaviest fruits.

### **Watermelon**

Watermelons, like pumpkins, have a big size when compared to other fruits. Although your local grocery shop may have entire watermelon on display, they are still large enough to fit in your basket and bring home. Your grocery store selection, on the other hand, pales in comparison to the biggest watermelon.

Chris Kent (USA) cultivated the world's biggest watermelon in 2013, weighing 350.5 pounds. He was honored at the Operation Pumpkin celebration in Ohio, which took place between October 3 and October 5 of the same year. Chris grows the largest watermelons using seeds from the Carolina Cross kind of watermelon.

The seeds are soaked in water for 60 minutes before being planted in potting soil. Seeds are kept indoors in a warm atmosphere for the first few days, and sprouting takes three to four days. Once the seeds have sprouted, they are stored outside.

### **Banana**

Bananas aren't particularly little, but they're also not very enormous. They may, however, develop to a broad range of sizes, much like other fruits.

Tecorone SL and Kabana SA of Spain cultivated the largest bunch of bananas in 2001. The bunch weighed 287 pounds and included roughly 473 bananas. The fruit was picked by several farmers with the intention of turning a desert into a tropical fruit plantation.

Bananas are high in magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B6, fiber, and manganese, among other nutrients. Banana leaves are wrapped around tamales in Mexico and sticky rice in various regions of Asia in numerous countries. Banana peels have also been used as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial to help wounds heal faster.

### **Pumpkin**

The pumpkin is one of the heaviest fruits on the planet, which should come as no surprise. After all, many people go to the pumpkin farm every year around Halloween to select a pumpkin for carving. However, hearing how big some pumpkins may become might be frightening.

Carlos Perez achieved a national record in Spain in 2003 with a pumpkin weighing 1,034 pounds. It was, in fact, one of the oldest records in existence.
Shirley Oliver established the national record for pumpkin weight in South Africa in 2016 with a pumpkin weighing 1,116 pounds. Matthias Wuersching of Germany cultivated a pumpkin that weighed 1,986 pounds the same year. The fruit now holds the German national record.

One of the most popular fruits in the world is the Atlantic gigantic pumpkin. It is, in reality, the world's heaviest and largest fruit. In 2016, Mathias Willemijns, a Belgian, developed one of the most famous Atlantic huge pumpkins. The huge pumpkin beat the world record at the time with its weight of 2,625 pounds.

In addition, it holds the record for being the largest fruit in Belgium.

Pumpkins are almost 90% water and have very little natural sugar. To put it another way, they don't taste like much. The majority of people utilize these heavyweights for things like boats because of this. Watch a man paddling his "boat" in this video.

### **Lemon**

Lemons are similar to bananas in that they are tiny and simple to handle. So it came as a surprise to see that the record for the largest lemon is very substantial.

Aharon Shemoel (Israel) cultivated the world's heaviest lemon on his field in 2003. The lemon had a diameter of 29 inches and a height of 13.7 inches. This lemon measured around 11.6 pounds and grew in a pair with another large lemon. Apart from that, in 2012, Jos√© Antonio Molina of Spain unearthed a 4.4-pound lemon (two kilos).

Lemon juice is used in a variety of sweets and pastries. Furthermore, the lemon's distinct flavor is employed to enhance a variety of vegetables, seafood, and poultry meals all over the world.

### **Apple**

In 2005, Japan produced the world's biggest apple. The apple was found by **Chisato Iwasaki** and weighed 4 pounds and 1 ounce. The Hokuto apple is a pink-striped spherical golden fruit. Farmers pick this fruit in the middle of the season, and it is a hybrid of the Mutsu and Fuji kinds.

A bigger apple exists, but it is not edible. It is located in Winchester, Virginia. Outside an antebellum home, a scarlet and massive apple rests. General Phil Sheridan used this home as his headquarters during the Civil War. The headquarters is currently a souvenir shop. If you want to go or are simply curious, go here.

While the exact size of this apple is unknown, it is enormous and well worth a visit if you happen to be in or around Winchester.

### **Jackfruit**

The world's heaviest jackfruit was grown in India. It weighed 94.18 pounds and measured 52 inches in circumference (132.08 centimeters). It was also 22.5 inches (57.15 cm) in length. Surprisingly, the fig and jackfruit trees belong to the same family.

Jackfruit is a popular fruit in the **Philippines**, Southeast Asia, and India, as well as eastern and central Africa. Furthermore, it is well-known in Brazil and Suriname. The color of the fruit changes from pale green to yellow as it ripens. Iron, calcium, and potassium are abundant in the fruit, which is also resistant to drought, disease, and pests.

### **Strawberry**

When you think of heavy fruit, you generally don't think of a strawberry. The strawberry, like other berries, is tiny enough that you can hold many in your palm at once. Some strawberries, on the other hand, are substantially larger than typical.

Anthony Snell of Herefordshire harvested a large strawberry on his fruit field on June 17, 2016. The strawberry was 0.19 pounds in weight (90 g). It was the largest strawberry ever cultivated in Herefordshire.
In the year 1983, G. In Kent, Anderson raised the world's largest strawberry. The fruit was 0.51 pounds in weight (231g).

When Mr. Koji Nakao, a Japanese farmer, noticed an abnormally large strawberry during harvest, he contacted Guinness World Records. With a circumference of 9.84 inches, a length of 4.72 inches to 11.81 inches, and a height of 3.15 inches, the fruit weighed 250 g, or little over half a pound.

Surprisingly, the enormous strawberry was a mutation, which can occur for a variety of causes. In this situation, many berries have merged to produce one large strawberry.

### **Last Thoughts**

As you can see, the pumpkin is the heaviest fruit on the planet. Unless you have a fruit that is larger than those, we propose that you do what fruit is supposed to be used for: eating and enjoying it. Enjoy your snacking.
