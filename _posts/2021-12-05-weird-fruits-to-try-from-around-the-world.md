Here are some weird and exotic fruits that you should taste at least once in your life. Some of them may not taste like the apples, bananas, or oranges we're used to, but if you enjoy variety, they're worth looking for. They're great on their own or mixed up with other seasonal fruits.

<br/><br/>

### **Ackee**

The ackee fruit is a mixed blessing in Jamaica. Although it originated in West Africa, it was introduced to Jamaica in 1778 and has since become the country's national fruit. If eaten incorrectly, however, ackee can produce the Jamaican Vomiting Sickness, which can result in coma or death, in addition to the self-explanatory symptoms. Because unripe ackee fruit contains the toxin hypoglycin, preparers must wait until the fruit's protective pods become red and open naturally before eating it. The yellow arilli, which surround the always-toxic black seeds, are the sole edible part once opened. With all of that danger comes a delectable reward: ackee with codfish, Jamaica's national dish.

### **Wood Apple**

### **Witch Finger Grapes**

Take notice for Halloween: these grapes are sweeter and a lot creepier than regular grapes.

### **Horned Melon**

The horned melon (or jelly melon) may be like a Super Mario villain, but it is actually rather mild and tastes like a watery cucumber.

<br/><br/>

### **Buddha's Hand**

The rind and pith of this strange-looking man are tasty and adaptable, but he lacks body and juice. Use it in the same way you would lemon peel or zest.

<br/><br/>

### **Physalis**

This fruit resembles a little tomato. What makes this fruit unique is that it grows with a papery husk encasing it, giving it the appearance of a bougainvillea flower. The little fruit is exposed once the husk is peeled from the berry. It's also known as the Chinese lantern because of the form of the plant.

### **Akebi**

Plants of the akubi family may be found in China, Taiwan, and Japan, although the fruits are most popular in Japan. In truth, "akebi" is a Japanese word. The palm-sized fruit has a purple pod that protects the white, finger-like flesh within. The meat is strewn with little black seeds that are delicious.

In Japan, the akebi is currently considered a speciality fruit and is utilized to prepare gourmet meals. It has a moderately sweet flavor.

### **Cupuacu**

Cupuacu is a fruit related to cacao, or cocoa, that grows widely throughout the Amazon basin. The fruit is brown in color and oblong in form, measuring around 20 centimeters in length. It typically weighs 1 to 2 kg.

The outer layer of skin is thick and tough. The flesh is delicate and white. It has a distinct, aromatic chocolate and pineapple taste. Cupuacu is high in vitamins and minerals that are considered to enhance the immune system, decrease cholesterol, and rejuvenate the skin and hair, while scientific data to back up these claims is currently lacking.

### **Watermelon Radish**

Watermelon radishes, also known as shinrimei, are heirloom kinds of daikon radishes that originated in China. They're a root vegetable that belongs to the Brassica family, which includes arugula, broccoli, and cabbage, among others.

The watermelon radish does not have a watermelon flavor. Instead, the flesh, which is green on the outside and deep crimson to brilliant red on the inside, looks a lot like its namesake.

### **Gac Fruit**

Gac fruits are about the size of a small melon and grow on vines that can reach 6 meters in length. Throughout Vietnam, they can be seen growing on lattices or arbors in gardens and rural residences. The fruits start off green, but mature to a dark orange hue and have a rounded oblong form with a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 13 cm. The coarse rind has a prickly shell that protects the mesocarp, a layer of pale orange spongy flesh that is normally discarded. The interior core is densely filled with edible magenta-red greasy sacs with a moderate flavor. They have a modest sweetness that some equate to a cucumber or melon with a tinge of carrot.

### **Kepel**

Kepel fruits are small to medium in size, with an oval to round form and a diameter of 3 to 6 cm. The skin is leathery, textured, and slightly harsh when mature, and the fruits ripen over a six-month period, moving from green to yellow-brown. The flesh has a creamy, semi-aqueous, and smooth consistency under the surface and is green when young, becoming yellow-orange as it ripens. 4 to 6 big, oval, light brown seeds are likewise encased in the flesh. The skin of the fruit may be softly scraped to identify whether it is ripe. The fruit is still immature if the scratched area displays a green color, but it is ripe to harvest if it is orange. Kepel fruits are fragrant and have a sweet, fruity, tropical flavor with notes of papaya, mango, and coconut.

### **Puhala or Hala**

The hala fruit is a huge edible fruit that is found in Southeast Asia, eastern Australia, the Pacific Islands, and Hawaii, and is made up of multiple pieces called keys or cones. The hala fruit tree, also known as the Tahitian screw pine or thatch screwpine, is one of the Pandanus species' 750 or so trees.

<br/><br/>

### **Salak Fruit or Snake Fruit**

![Weird Fruits to Try From Around the World -  Salak](/assets/images/salak-fruit.jpg)

Snake fruit is a Southeast Asian natural growing jewel.

The fruit's skin is scaly and thorny, like that of a snake, yet the inside is sweeter than honey, tart like a pineapple, and wonderfully juicy. Its flesh is somewhat acidic, giving your tongue a tingling sensation similar to that of citrus.

The flavor is excellent, with a rich flavor packaged in a devastating grenade-like container.
