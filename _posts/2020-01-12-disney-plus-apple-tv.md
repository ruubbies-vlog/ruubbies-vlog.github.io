Disney+ is an online streaming service that enables customers to watch on-demand movies and TV shows. The streaming service is available to watch on a range of devices, including enabling customers to watch Disney+ on Apple TV. 

Disney+ has been compatible with all Apple devices since it launched in November 2019, enabling users to watch on iPad, iPhone, iPod and Apple TV, which is a high-end streaming device.

This article will provide an overview of how to sign up for Disney+, how to watch Disney Plus on Apple TV, and how to download the service’s content. 


What is Disney+?
----------------

Disney+ is one of the more recent entries into the ever-expanding online streaming market. It provides an on-demand library of content that includes thousands of movies and TV show episodes. 

The service is home to all Disney content and original programming, which includes its classic animated movies and more recent Pixar films. Disney+ is also the place to watch the entire collection of Marvel and _Star Wars_ film franchises.

Disney+ is available for customers to subscribe monthly or annually, which costs $6.99/mo. or $69.99/yr.

Watch Disney+ on these Apple TV models
--------------------------------------

Disney+ is only available to watch on the two current Apple TV streaming device models. These are the Apple TV HD and the Apple TV 4K.

The Apple TV HD (from $149.99)  is the fourth generation of Apple devices — it was released in 2015. It enables users to watch their favorite streaming services, such as Disney+, through the Apple App Store on the device’s tvOS operating system. It comes with 32GB of storage space and supports up to 1080p high-definition (HD) video quality and Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 surround sound. 

The Apple TV 4K (from $179.99) is the fifth generation Apple device, which was first released in 2017. It enables users to up their viewing options to 4K, which offers four times the pixel resolution and picture quality of standard HD. However, this is only possible on a TV set that also supports 4K video quality. It also offers leading streaming quality with Dolby Vision High-Definition-Imaging (HDR) and Dolby Atmos audio. The 4K Apple TV model is available with either 32 GB or 64 GB of storage space.

Disney+ isn’t compatible with the Apple TV first-, second- and third-generation devices, which have now been made obsolete by Apple. The Disney+ app isn’t available on these older devices. However, users that have one of these devices can watch Disney+ through an Apple iPad or iPhone and using the AirPlay feature to stream the service through their Apple TV.

Users will need to have a subscription to Disney+ to watch the service on their Apple TV streaming device. However, it’s also possible to subscribe to Disney+ on Apple TV streaming devices.

Disney+ is available on these Apple TV models:

*   Apple TV HD (from $149.99)
