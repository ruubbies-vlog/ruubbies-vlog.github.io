Here are seven amazing facts about the Philippines to offer you a better understanding of this fascinating country.

### **The Monkey-Eating Eagle is the country's national bird.**

The Philippine Eagle is also known as the monkey-eating eagle, which is a misnomer. It doesn't eat monkeys, but it does devour pigs, snakes, and bats, which aren't exactly little. It's easy to understand how it does this with a wingspan of roughly two hopping,.

It's also one of the world's rarest and most powerful birds, and killing one comes with a high price tag: 12 years in prison.

### **Jeepneys are still the most popular means of transportation in the Philippines.**

The Philippines is known for its jeepneys. Thousands of excess Jeeps were left behind by American forces after WWII. These were put together by resourceful Filipinos and made into transport vehicles that can hold up to 20 people at a time. They're simple to detect because they're frequently painted in bright colors and have phrases emblazoned on them.

To relieve traffic congestion in the city, jeepneys are gradually being phased out in favor of more environmentally friendly options. However, there are still lots of them plowing through the streets, so you should be able to catch one.

### **There are more volcanoes on this island than there are towns.**

Camiguin is the only island on the earth with more volcanoes than towns while being only 14 miles long and 8.5 miles wide. It also has the most volcanoes per square mile of any island on the planet.
