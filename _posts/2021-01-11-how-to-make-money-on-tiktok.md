One of the newest ways to generate money online is to monetize your TikTok videos. Here are a few choices for you to consider.

### **Sponsorships for audio**

TikTok is primarily an audio network, with songs and audio segments frequently going popular on the internet â€“ consider Lil Nas X's Billboard 100 smash "Old Town Road."

Artists looking to follow in Lil Nas X's footsteps have begun to pay TikTok influencers to embed their recordings in their posts. Skylar Krupa, who shares videos of his grandparents, has monetized his expanding viewership using this way. He charges $25 for every 25,000 followers.

Because there is no formal means to organize audio sponsorships, youths who want to monetise their following in this way, or even grandparents like the grandparents in the scenario above, must contact artists directly or through artist management teams.

### **Product Sales**

Creators who wish to directly monetize their audiences without relying on advertising dollars from brands can offer merchandise and products to them. Creators can now sell products directly in TikTok thanks to a partnership with Teespring. TikTok producers can choose from 180 different products to create their designs.

In September 2020, TikTok and Teespring launched an initial cohort of 7,000 creators to test the integration. They're anticipated to reveal how other creators can begin using the integration.

In their profile, creators can also provide links to a personal website or an alternate merchandise platform where fans can purchase stuff.

### **Promote a Company or a Brand**

On TikTok, audio sponsorships aren't the only method to make money from branded content. Creators can also use their videos to aid in the introduction and promotion of items by brands or enterprises.

Mucinex, a cold and flu drug, was one among the first brands to use TikTok for influencer marketing. During the cold and flu season, Mucinex collaborated with producers to advertise its products. TikTok influencers, such as the brother-sister combo OurFire, were invited to take part in the #BeatTheZombieFunk competition.

Creators without representation who want to get started with brand sponsorships can approach brands and businesses directly or look for opportunities on TikTok's official Creator Marketplace.

### **TikTok will pay you**

TikTok aspires to assist its most successful creators in achieving success and earning money only through the platform. In order to achieve this goal, it has established a $200 million creator's fund, with the goal of increasing it to $1 billion by 2023. TikTok will pay creators directly for generating videos under this scheme.

TikTok has been tight-lipped on how much creators can earn and how many will be funded, as well as the minimum amount of followers required to qualify. According to certain TikTok experts, you need at least 10,000 followers and 10,000 views on your profile during the last 30 days, however the site has not confirmed this.

Creators can submit their applications using their TikTok profiles. If you fulfill TikTok's basic qualifications, you'll receive an offer to apply straight from them in the notifications section of your messages.

### **Convert Diamonds from Gifts**

Creators that offer live streams where their fans send them presents purchased with virtual coins purchased within the platform are a popular way to make money on TikTok. Creators can then turn these presents into "diamonds," which are TikTok's virtual credits that can be redeemed. Fans must be at least 18 years old in order to acquire coins.

Creators who are 18 years old or older can cash out their diamonds at any time for a cash value determined by TikTok. Payment is made to the creator's Paypal account of choice. Withdrawals from TikTok are subject to daily limits, which are indicated throughout the withdrawal process.

### **How Much Money Can You Earn on TikTok**

The amount of money you may make on TikTok varies, but if your material gets popular, it can be lucrative, just like any other social media platform. There are currently no third-party sources that have objectively assessed the amount of money TikTok creators make.

Reviewing numbers is one way to estimate wages. An influencer agency, TalentX Entertainment, believes that advertisers pay between $0.01 and $0.02 every video view on TikTok.

Then there's TikTok's creator fund, which the company hopes will incentivize producers to use the site full-time to create content. It hasn't said how much a full-time salary would be, but the idea is that it would be big enough that artists wouldn't need to work other jobs.
