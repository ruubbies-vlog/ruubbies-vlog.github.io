Have you had another dream about your ex, despite the fact that you're sure you're over them? Dreams that come and go or repeat themselves can make you doubt yourself. They can even make you question whether you are missing them secretly, deep down.

<br/><br/>

### **You are in desperate need of closure**

We can have nightmares about an ex because we aren't happy with way things ended. Breakups rarely go as planned, whether you want to end the relationship or not. Perhaps you wish you had said something else. Perhaps you wish you had acted differently. Perhaps something he or she said bothered you and stuck with you. But, before you grab for your phone to text your ex to acquire this 'closure,' keep in mind that we don't need to actually speak to an ex to feel settled with the end of a relationship. A dream can be a way of attempting to reach that closure on our own.

### **In your current relationship, you have unmet needs**

Even if you're in love with your new partner, there are bound to be some aspects of the relationship that you wish were different. Perhaps your ex did something that you wish your current partner did, either emotionally or sexually. In this situation, the dream may be present to assist you identify an unmet need so you can discuss it with your existing spouse. (And no, you don't have to say you had a dream about your ex to accomplish this.)

### **You simply haven't moved on from your ex**

This is the least likely circumstance in my clinical experience. When someone isn't over their ex, they usually realize it and talk about it during their waking hours. There are times when someone is simply out of touch with their emotional process and isn't over their ex, which manifests itself in their nightmares. If this is the case, you'll need to conduct some soul-searching. It's critical to consider why the relationship ended, what didn't work for both parties, and whether or not it's something you truly desire. Keep in mind that once a relationship has ended, people often idealize it or feel lonely and want to reconnect with someone they know.

### **You're heartbroken by the loss of the relationship**

Even if the breakup is for the best, we must mourn the loss of the relationship and the person in our lives. And everything we don't get done during our waking hours gets done while we sleep. You may have dreams about your ex-girlfriend dying, not because you want her to (although that does happen! ), but because you are mourning the end of that relationship. This is an important aspect of letting go.

### **You're dealing over a past traumatic experience**

Our unconscious mind is constantly attempting to settle unsolved difficulties, whether they stem from our childhood, previous relationships, or some other trauma. If you have an unsolved issue in your life, it will most certainly follow you from one relationship to the next. If your first love betrayed you, for example, you can have a dream about cheating on your new love with your ex to work through your trust issues. To put it another way, your ex might just be a stand-in for your unconscious as it works through the greater blockage.

### **You're applying what you've learnt from your previous relationship to your new one**

The more we get away from a separation, the more conscious we become. As a result, it's not unusual to go through a breakup in stages, even after you think you've'moved on.' Dreaming about someone you used to love can sometimes be a means of helping you apply the lessons you learnt in your past relationship to your new one. Consider it a present â€” and a sign that you're maturing.

<br/><br/>

### **Something else is represented by your Ex**

People, places, and things are frequently symbolic in dreams. Your ex could represent a period in your life or something else significant. When you evaluate the dream, an useful question to ask yourself is: what sentiments or memories does the individual evoke in you? This might serve as a guide to help you better comprehend what he or she represents. It can also assist you in working through and processing whatever issue you're dealing with (that probably has nothing to do with your ex).

### **Conclusion**

Even after we've moved on, we sometimes have dreams about our ex-partners. Rather than being unwelcome ghosts from the past, dreams about our ex-partners can be opportunities to grow and heal. We can unlock the deeper secrets beyond the surface when we approach these dreams with interest rather than dread.
